    Most of what is studied and documented about this particular issue is through an ecological lens. Some solutions advocated for combatting noise pollution are changing mixtures for roads to include crumb rubber to make the noise created by vehicles on it quieter (Vázquez, Terán, Viñuela, Paje, 2014).
