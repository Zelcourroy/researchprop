    Urban noise pollution includes how noise within a city affects daily lives and overall quality of life for city dwellers. It can affect a wide variety of people based on the differences in their daily lives. For instance, a pedestrian or cyclist will have a different level of causes than a person who mostly drives. This is the same for people that spend their whole day in a city versus someone who only commutes there for work. Noise pollution can cause high blood pressure and hearing loss, amongst other things.
