     Firstly, I created posters and sent emails to promote subjects to join my research.
My method of investigation was to interview individuals and conduct focus groups speaking on my topic. This is the best method for my research because the data <br>
     needed is from primary sources and deals with personal thoughts on the topic. My participants were undergraduate students at PSU.
<br>
 I asked individual students one at a time my questions and gave them a brief description of noise pollution.
Then ask the broad question: what sort of man made noises do you hear in the city during your day? The participants listed noises heard. Then during another part of data collection the same presentation and questions were shown to a group of students at once.
